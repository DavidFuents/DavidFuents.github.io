For this project I decided to create a very basic e-commerce site. This site was inspired by another hobby of mine which is sewing. I like making my own jackets and pants so I hope to one day sell a few. It has an admin dashboard which is where you can add products to the site, create new collections and new categories. I do plan on adding new features like customer accounts and a cart feature.
