Ever since my first computer science class in middle school I have been interested in software engineering. My teacher was able to help me find an interest I never knew I had. And I knew I was enjoying makings sites and small scripts because that was the class I look most forward to every day. There was a time in high school where I tried learning code on my own but got nowhere, I needed a guide line. I could not keep myself learning one language, one day I tried C++ the next it would be PHP but never fully learned any. After quarantine started this year, I realized I wanted to get a job that can be done from home. Not having anything to do during this time and no job made me want to stick to a language and learn it well enough to start making things. I realized I still enjoy coding as much as I did in middle school and having a guide on what to learn makes things easier for me. I know during the next few months I am going to enjoy making new things I never thought I could make. I hope it can even lead to a job some day.
